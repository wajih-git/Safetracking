The first remote geolocalisation app for KaiOS.
The Safetracking app enables the device to share its geolocation for set period of time and set intervals defined in the setting page.
Tested on KaiOS 2.5. 
As the geolocation is shared via SMS, it works well on 4G networks as well as 2G/3G and poor coverage areas. 
Do not use without an unlimited SMS plan. Depending on the selected settings, a large number of location SMS could be sent. 
The Safetracking app can only be started and stopped on the KaiOS device where the app is installed.
